Use the HTML `<canvas>` element and JavaScript to draw 2D graphics.

If you haven't worked through the [Animate Your Name](http://www.codecademy.com/goals/animate-your-name) goal yet, go do that first so you'll see where we're heading with this. 

Love the bubbles? Wish there were more shapes than just circles and squares?

The goal of this challenge is for you to develop the code to draw another shape. Here are some things to help you get started:

- [Can I have more shapes?](http://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/5338643d9c4e9dd03e006f6f) Maciej will show you how to make right angle triangles and hearts.  -- YOU should do something new
- [Draw with JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-SWM11/0/1) - a set of 8 exercises 
- [Canvas tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial) from MDN

Get out your graph paper and start sketching - geometry class should have been this much fun.

 1. Show us your finished code snippet for drawing the new shape. It should be in the same format as you see in *"Can I have more shapes?"*. That way it can easily be dropped into bubbles.js as another `else if`. Tell us how you felt putting it together. Did you find any good resources on the web?
 2. Show us a **little** screen capture of a sample of your new shape, just like the triangle and heart images you see here. That will make this a very fun looking discussion.
 3. If you've done your developing online, link us to a live version of your code so we can all play!  [Here is an example](http://jsbin.com/qiyug/1/edit?output) using jsbin.com and another example [using a codebit](http://www.codecademy.com/AlbionsRefuge/codebits/QExfd7).
