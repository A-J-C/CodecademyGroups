**Want to learn HTML5 game development?** You're in the right place!

Visit our website at http://html5-games.github.io (Want to help with the next version of the site? See [this post](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html5-game-development/discussions/51709b04977bc97e65000487))

Because HTML5 gamedev uses JavaScript & HTML, if you have not already done so, I recommend that you start the:

 - [JavaScript Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
 - [Web Fundamentals Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

When you are fairly comfortable with JavaScript and HTML, select a track and begin your journey towards creating awesome games.
