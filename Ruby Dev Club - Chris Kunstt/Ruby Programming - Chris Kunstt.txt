The Ruby Programming book is available on the web. There are web, printable, and pdf versions of the book. The wikibooks page also shows the Available Standard Library Modules, and additional sections.

One of the links is to Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby, by "why the lucky stiff". Be sure to check it out.
