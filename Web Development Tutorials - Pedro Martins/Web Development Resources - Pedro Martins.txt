Sometimes users make projects and they wish to show them. Other times they ask for help and feedback and the group helps the creator making a good resource. 

Resources can be websites, tools that you can use to make websites, answer to website related questions, or anything at all that is related to web development.

In the end, such resources are kept because they represent valuable assets that other can explore and learn with. 

This discussion has the list of all currently **kept and operational** resources. You are welcome to visit them and learn from their source code to improve your skills!
