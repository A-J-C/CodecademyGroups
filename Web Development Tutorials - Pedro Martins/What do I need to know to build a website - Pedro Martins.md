## Introduction
Most new users that join our group have no idea nor background on how to start their own websites whatsoever. They start making some courses because they believe that is going to help them, but even then when they finish they have no idea where and how to apply that knowledge, thus making no idea how to create a website. Here we will tackle those problems in order to give you a path to follow.
Thus, I propose to answer the following questions in this article:

- What is the type of my Website?
- What do I need to know to make my Website? What knowledge to I need?
- What tools should I use to make my Website?
- Where do I make my Website available to the world?
- Are there any easier ways to make a Website?

Know that you will always have alternatives in your choices, and it is how you handle those alternatives and which alternatives you chose that will define your project and you as a web designer or engineer.

## Types of websites
Before we start on a quest to learn anything we must first ask ourselves a question: **What exactly are we going to do?**. Knowing the answer to this question will help us manage our focus in the areas that best contribute to the project.

With this in mind, there are two types of Websites that you can do:

- Static Websites
- Dynamic Websites

The answer to the previous question lies in here. If you want to create a Static Website then you need to focus on front-end development and languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you want to create a Dynamic Websites, then you need to consider back-end development and languages such as PHP, Ruby or Python. 

I will not delve deep into this matter, mainly because I already covered it in detail in the [Website Hosting - Your Needs and Your Free Choices][hosting-guide] guide. Therefore if you are not familiar with this terminology I strongly recommend that you read that entire guide before proceeding. 

## Languages and Resources
As I explained before, the languages you need to learn and how you learn them depend on your focus. If you are focusing your attention in front-end development (making a Static Website for example) then you should learn the following languages:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

HTML and CSS are without question the core of any Website. JavaScript is optional but it will make your life easier by enabling the understanding and use of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery. 

Consequently, you should complete the following CodeCademy tracks **in the given order**:

1. [Web Fundamentals][web-fundamentals-track] - covers HTML and CSS basics;
2. [JavaScript][javascript-track] - light introduction to JavaScript. Consider making also the [Original JavaScript Track][javascript-original-track];
3. [jQuery][jquery-track] - introduction to jQuery's JavaScript functions. Requires a good understanding of JavaScript to be used efficiently and independently.

However, CodeCademy only provides brief introductions in these matters. It is therefore your job to seek help in other places. To accommodate such end, I have prepared a list of resources that you should explore:

- [Programming Motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html#HTML%20/%20CSS) - list of books and resources for several programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Pyhton, etc (PS: the Website title is awesome. And it has Samuel L. Jackson);
- [webplatform.org](http://www.webplatform.org/) - website containing several tutorials for CSS and HTML;
- [Opera Web Standards](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/#toc) - Massive tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML 5 and more;
- [sitepoint](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css) - Explains CSS, HTML and JavaScript function with examples. It has a similar purpose to wc3schools but it is updated and more reliable;
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs) - Resources on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML 5, DOM and AJAX. **The source** that you should always recommend; 
- [HTML Dog Tutorials](http://www.htmldog.com/) - a list of tutorials about HTML, CSS and JavaScript;
- [Develop PHP](http://www.developphp.com/) - despite its title, it is a website that has resources and videos on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and more;
- [Required JavaScript Reading](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/required-javascript-reading/) - list of JavaScript books, freebies, blogs and classes that you can check; 
- [append.to](http://learn.appendto.com/) - website with video tutorials and real world examples to learn JavaScript;
- [jQuery learning center](http://learn.jquery.com/) - jQuery documentation with examples;
-  [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) - tutorial videos and exercises in CodeSchool about jQuery. Highly recommended, but later lessons have to be payed;
- [65 jQuery Tutorials](http://www.designyourway.net/blog/resources/65-jquery-tutorials-to-help-you-customize-your-site/) - 65 jQuery Tutorials To Help You Customize Your Site.

These are the three basic steps of any front-end developer. If you never made a website before, you should focus on these. 

When it comes to back-end development (making Dynamic Websites which require sever-scripting) the path is not so linear. There is a multitude of languages that you can use for your server. To answer this call, CodeCademy provides tracks on several server-scripting languages:

- [PHP][php-track];
- [Ruby][ruby-track];
- [Python][python-track].

However, there are a lot more you can use, such as Java, Scala, Perl, C etc. You can check more languages in [this Wikipedia list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting), which also explains what server-scripting is.

Once again CodeCademy only give you a very light introduction in each language. If you want to learn them you should also search elsewhere:

## Frameworks
For those of you who do not know, a Framework is a generic program, built with the purpose of helping you code faster, easier, safer and more consistently. There are many other definitions of *What is a framework?*:

- [Software Framework Wiki](Software framework)
- [Definition: Framework](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/framework)
- [A Framework is](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5381/What-Is-A-Framework)
- [Advantages of using software framework](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2506943/advantages-of-using-software-framework)

But for now I believe that my simple explanation will suffice. Using Frameworks has advantages and disadvantages like any other solution. In a nutshell you can say that:

- Frameworks help you code faster, safer, easier and remove a lot of repetitive work from your hands.
- But they are sometimes resource heavy, should not be used in small projects and they take both time and effort to learn and master.

For more reading about advantages and disadvantages I recommend:

- [Software Framework Advantages and Disadvantages](http://nagbhushan.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/framework-advantages-and-disadvantages/)
- [Benefits and Pitfalls of Using Code Frameworks](http://speckyboy.com/2012/01/18/benefits-and-pitfalls-of-using-code-frameworks/)

Still, when making websites I strongly recommend the use Frameworks. It will help a lot and you will have results to show a lot faster too.

With this in mind, there are two special types of frameworks that we can use to make our Web Developing / Design job easier:

- **Front-end Frameworks:** they deal with HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript. They provide you with software alternatives that make designing and creating Web-pages easier, faster and safer. An examples of a front-end framework is Twitter Bootstrap, which we cover in the [Twitter Bootstrap - Websites for all Screens, Devices, Browsers and more!][bootstrap-tutorial] tutorial. They can be used (as a personal opinion, you **should always use one**) on both Static Websites and Dynamic Websites so you can create a nice and clean user interfaces.
- **Back-end Frameworks:** these deal with server scripting and databases. They provide ways of easily accessing and managing your databases while also permitting other more dynamic behaviors. Examples of such frameworks are Ruby-on-Rails for Ruby, Yii, Zend and PHPCake for PHP Django for Python and Play for Java/Scala. Back-end frameworks are only necessary in Dynamic Websites because those need to keep databases and to dynamically manage their data.

So, just to be clear, if you are making a Static Website, you only need a Front-end Framework. If you are developing a Dynamic Website, we need both a Front-end and a Back-end Framework.

For a good list of Front-end frameworks I strongly recommend you to read the [Twitter Bootstrap - Websites for all Screens, Devices, Browsers and more!][bootstrap-tutorial] tutorial. 

For a list of back-end frameworks, the choice will depend on your preferred language:
**PHP:**

- [PHP Frameworks List](http://www.phpframeworks.com/)
- [Best PHP Frameworks](http://codegeekz.com/best-php-frameworks-for-developers/)

**Ruby**

- [The small, medium, and large of Ruby Frameworks](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/the-small-medium-and-large-of-ruby-frameworks/)
- [List of Ruby Web Frameworks](http://vemod.net/list-of-ruby-web-frameworks)
- [Web App Frameworks](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/web_app_frameworks)

**Python**

- [4 Python Web Frameworks Compared ](http://www.sixfeetup.com/blog/4-python-web-frameworks-compared)
- [Web Frameworks for Python](http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks)
- [What's a good lightweight Python MVC framework?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68986/whats-a-good-lightweight-python-mvc-framework)

And finally, the Wikipedia list which covers PHP, Ruby, Python and a lot more:

- [Back-end Frameworks Wiki List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks)

So, which Framework to choose? Well, that **should** depend mainly on:

- Your preferred language: is it PHP, Ruby or Python?
- Is the Framework documentation good? 
- How many tutorials and guides can I find in the Internet regarding that specific Framework? 
- Power vs Time: Powerful frameworks take more time to master - choose well.

## Web development tools
Once you know what you must learn and in which order you must do it, you must choose the tools you are going to work with. If you work in team or solo, it does not matter, our [Web Development Tools - Introduction][tools-guide] guide has all that you need, and it is mandatory reading. 

## Hosting
Now that you know how to create your website it is time you learn how to share it with the world. This is (once again) covered in our  [Website Hosting - Your Needs and Your Free Choices][hosting-guide] guide. If you have not yet read it all, now is definitely the time to do so.

## Going further
In this guide we have only given you the basics of how to get started. However the Internet is a very big place with a lot of resources. There are many other frameworks, courses, universities and websites like CodeCademy out there able to help you. Therefore, I strongly recommend you to also read our [Alternative to CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects/discussions/52363231f10c60819600030a) Guide, and to check our [Resources for front-end Web Development](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects/discussions/51df1e69631fe985f00014b8) Resource which is also rich in tutorials and information about front-end frameworks and HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Conclusion
If you have read all the recommendations by now you should be able to answer the questions proposed in the Introduction. 

Your Website is Static if it does not need to keep data from users in a database and does not need server management, otherwise it is dynamic.

If you wish to create a Static Website (focused on front-end development) you need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with jQuery being an optional bonus provided by CodeCademy. If you wish to create a Dynamic Website then you definitely need to learn Python, Ruby or PHP and you need to choose a framework as well.

There are many coding tools you can use, our [Web Development Tools - Introduction][tools-guide] guide reviewed many of them and detailed their main characteristics, but in the end you simply have to try them and decide on your own which one fits your needs and your work style.

To make your Website available to the world you need a server to host it and a service to give it a name. All you need yo know is explain in our [Website Hosting - Your Needs and Your Free Choices][hosting-guide] guide.

Finally, there are easier ways to create Websites, by using front-end and back-end frameworks you can develop websites easier, faster and safer by using an array of pre-made solutions.

Even if you never made a website, by now you should have an idea (even if a small one) about what you should do. This guide's main purpose is to give you a path and an objective to tackle. The rest is up to you. 

I wish you good winds in learning, if you are reading this, you probably need them :P
