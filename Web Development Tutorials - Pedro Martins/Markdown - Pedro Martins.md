This guide was requested by [tp9](http://www.codecademy.com/tp9), and so as promised, here it is.

## Prior Requirements:

- [Web Fundamentals][web_fundamentals] (optional)

## 1. Introduction
So maybe you have wondered how to add links in your Codecademy posts, or maybe you want to learn how to make headers or lists and how to make text look bold or Italic. Here you can learn all of that and even more. 
This however, is just a simple guide. The idea in this guide is not to tell you everything, but instead to just *guide* you to the correct sources and information that will contain the all the information you are looking for and even more.
Still, by the end of this tutorial you should be able to answer the following questions:

- What is Markdown?
- How can Markdown help me?
- What are Markdown Flavors?

## 2. Markdown

### 2.1 What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language created to allow people to:

 > “write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)”.

If this definition sounds complex, just think as Markdown as a simplified [WYSIWYG][wysiwyg] (what you see is what you get) type of formatting, created so people all over the world can create text for their blogs, and write their posts in forums and other websites (such as Codecademy, GitHub, Reddit and StackOverflow) in an easy way and having an immediate idea on how the text is going to look after.

### 2.2 Markdown Limitations
Markdown is heavily influenced by HTML and it actually tries to achieve the same thing - to allow people to format their texts and still be able to read them. However Markdown is a lot simpler than HTML thus making your posts more legible and easier to write. However, this comes at a great cost, in order to be simple Markdown only allows for a subset of HTML, thus raising some barriers to people who wish to deliver more complex formatted text.
To fix  this problem you either have to use HTML or to create a Markdown *flavor*. Markdown flavors are different versions of Markdown that are tailored to specific needs, adding or editing some Markdown functionalities to the [standard Markdown][official_markdown]. Some examples of Markdown flavors are:

- [GitHub][github_flavor]
- [stackoverflow][stackoverflow_flavor]
- [reddit][reddit_flavor]
- [Garrett][garret_flavor]

### 2.3 Why Markdown?
Now you are probably thinking, why can I simply not use HTML? Well, because writing in Markdown is a lot easier for us. Could you imagine if you had to write every post in Codecademy using HTML syntax? Sure your posts would be great, but it would be a nightmare for you to write them, or to edit them later due to all of the tags that your messages would need to have. Markdown fixes this problem, by selecting only a subset of commonly used HTML functions and simplifying their use.

### 2.4 What flavor of Markdown does Codecademy use? 
Codecademy uses the standard flavor, but with a special security feature that **does not allow HTML tags**.  To better understand this issue, please refer to [How do I use Markdown securely?][secure_markdown] post in IT Security.

### Where can I learn Markdown for my Codecademy posts?
If you wish to learn more about this, you should check out the [standard Markdown][official_markdown], and try out Codecademy's [Mastering Markdown][mastering_markdown] course !

## 3. Markdown Editors
If you are a blogger or if you just want to make or even save a long post in CodeCademy you will eventually need to learn how to use a Markdown editor. Markdown editors are usually quite simple, but there are two main types of editors that I refer in this section:

- Off-line editors
- On-line editors

Thus, in the following sections, we explain the main differences between these two types of editors by resorting to our [Introduction to Web Development Tools][intro-dev-tools] guide and then we suggest a list of free editors. Keep in mind however, that markdown has many flavors, therefore many of the editors we suggest are optimized for specific flavors of markdown, thus making it important for you to read the website's of the editors carefully in order to make an informed choice.

### 3.1 Off-line editors
These editors resemble the **Text Editors** discussed in our guide [Introduction to Web Development Tools][intro-dev-tools]. They share many of their features so discussing them here would be redundant - I strongly recommend you to read the Text Editors section of that guide for more information on the general characteristic of text editors. 

Now that this is finally out of the way, we can finally suggest some Markdown off-line editors, organized by Operative system:

- Windows:
    - [Markdownpad](http://markdownpad.com/)
    - [texts.io](http://www.texts.io/)
    - [Markdown#Editor](http://hibara.org/software/markdownsharpeditor/)
    - [Macdrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/2011/08/beautiful-markdown-editor-for-windows.html)

### 3.2 On-line editors
On-line editors are **Online Tools** that you can use to code. You can check more about the advantages and disadvantages of using such tools by reading the respective section in our [Introduction to Web Development Tools][intro-dev-tools] guide. These type of editors is becoming more used, and some of them even have synchronization with other services such as Dropbox, so they can be a good bet if you always have an a stable and good internet connection near you. Thus, without further delay, here are our suggestions:

- [markable.in](http://markable.in)
- [dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)
- [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/)
- [compileonline](http://www.compileonline.com/try_markdown_online.php)

### 3.3 More editors and Links
In this section I present you with some articles that are very rich and suggest a lot of markdown editors, both on-line and off-line as well. Feel free to suggest more similar articles if you find:

## 4. Summary
In conclusion, Markdown is what we are using when writing our posts here in Codecademy. It is a simplified language that addresses how you format your text and how you can present it. 
Markdown can help you because by knowing Markdown, you will be able to make your posts formatted, thus presenting your information better to the people in Codecademy's forums.
Finally, Markdown is quite limited, and to fix that many websites created their own flavors of Markdown. Codecademy uses the standard flavor without HTML permission.
Furthermore there are a lot of on-line and off-line tools that you can use to write markdown, but some of them are optimized for certain markdown flavors, so you have to be careful when choosing.
