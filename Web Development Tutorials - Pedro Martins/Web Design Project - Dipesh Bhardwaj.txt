**PROJECT WEBSITE:** http://uikit.gweb.io/

Most of you have done web basics course of Codecademy, so here is challenge for all of you. In this project all you have to do is to design an exact duplicate of the project website mentioned on the top of this challenge.

Above website is developed using:

**UIKIT** 

> A lightweight and modular front-end framework used for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

There are lots of tweaks in the project page and all you have to do is achieve that using this framework and with your HTML and CSS skills.

Also for **tooltips** you have to use a different plugin: 

**Tooltipster**

> A powerful, flexible jQuery plugin enabling you to easily create semantic, modern tooltips enhanced with the power of CSS.

Remember to explore the webpage completely as there are lots of features and effects in it which you have to create exactly as presented in the main project site.

For graphics and images you can fetch them from the site easily and there is one more recommendation for you guys, that instead of using the `uikit.min.css` file provided by the **uikit** official website use this file:

[uikit.docs.min.css][1]


Website Links:

 1. [UIKIT][2]
 2. [Tooltipster][3]
 3. [Project Site][4]
 4. [uikit.docs.min.css][5]
