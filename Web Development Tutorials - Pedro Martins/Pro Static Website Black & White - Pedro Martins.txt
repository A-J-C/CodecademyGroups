So, someone wants you to make a professional looking website for a company. This is serious business and is well played, but you do not have any money, so you can only use free software.

First thing the boss did, was to hire a graphic designer. The designer made a few mockups and then concluded that the final look should be this:

The designer created a black version and a white version. Your client doesn't care which one you choose - he wants a professional website and he needs you to do a good job coding!

Before you can start, you should go here and choose a code editor that you like:

2 - Depending on your browser you will need addons to:
2.1 - Take screenshots of certain areas in a page, to get the images and logos
2.2 - Color picker tool, to know which colors to use
2.3 Page ruler tool, to know distances and sizes in pixels

If you are a beginner, you have some learning to do:
1 - Finish Web Fundamentals course in codecademy: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web
2 - Finish the 30day course in tutsplus about web design: http://learncss.tutsplus.com/

Your team has already studied the given tutorials and this is the current source code:

Homework:
1 - Looks like someone is an idiot and replaced the images of the webpage with some random metal musicians. Fix that!
2 - Create the last missing page!
3 - Create the webpage in black version for the client

Once you have fixed the webpage, you need to consider hosting, read this post:

After reading the hosting webpage post answer the following:
1 - Can I use dropbox to host this specific example of a website?
2 - Why is is a good idea or a bad idea?
3 - What if I want to make a blog and allow users to save data?

Happy learning!
