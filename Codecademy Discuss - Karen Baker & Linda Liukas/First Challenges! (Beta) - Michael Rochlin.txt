###***Updated I've added a 6th challenge to the python challenges***###


I've created 5 basic challenges as per the Challenges proposal.

A few notes:  
1- These are very very basic  
2- The SCT's on these are not very advanced. They simply test for correct output. (I was having some trouble even with this but I think I got the bugs out...)  
3- There are many features that will need to be added in order to make the Challenges idea work. These include:

 * Publishing Lessons with only 1 part
 * Allowing for multiple languages for the same challenge
 * Better sharing options (I hear this is on the way in revamped Labs?)
 * Allow SCT, or non-User visible code, to run before the User's code runs.
 * Grading system

For now, heres just a small sample of what can be done in the future. The idea, for now, is that people share their code once they've completed the lesson.

Python set 1:

Javascript set 1: (Note: I have 0 prior experience with Javascript SCTs so IDK how this came out. Also, some challenges have been modified for Javascript)

Good Luck!

UPDATE: all SCT problems should now be fixed
