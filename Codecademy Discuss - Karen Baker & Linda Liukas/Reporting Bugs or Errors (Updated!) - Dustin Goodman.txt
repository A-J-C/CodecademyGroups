Howdy folks,

There have been a lot of bugs popping up here and there around the site which I'm sure many of you are finding aggravating. The developers at Codecademy are doing their very best to fix these bugs asap when they appear. However, the engineers and many of the Codecademy staff members are not on the forums during the day so posting threads like "This Cool Feature is Broken" actually doesn't expedite the process for getting them fixed. Hence, there is a new process for reporting errors you see. It goes like this:

1) **If you are experiencing a lesson specific bug**, join [Alex](http://www.codecademy.com/alexcraig)'s [Buggy Exercises][1] group. First off, read their [rules and instructions][2] to make sure you format your report correctly and give all required information. Then, check to make sure your bug hasn't already been reported. [This thread][3] contains a list of all reported issues. Checking against this list will help the moderators and admins distinguish all the issues so we can fix them quickly.

2) **If you are experiencing an issue with the website**, join [Nick](http://www.codecademy.com/nedwards)'s [Codecademy Bug Reporting][4] group. Again, read their [rules and instructions][5] before posting. Also, verify that your bug has not already been reporting by checking [this thread][6].

3) **Finally, I highly recommend reading [Karen](http://www.codecademy.com/karenbaker)'s post on [writing a good bug report][7] before posting.** She gives great details on how to report information so that the staff can help fix the problem/issue you're experiencing.

These resources are not meant for suggesting new features, but we love hearing your feedback so feel free to send these ideas to contact@codecademy.com.

Thanks for your cooperation!
