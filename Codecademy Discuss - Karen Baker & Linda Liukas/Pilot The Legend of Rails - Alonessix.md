Pre-post note: This tutorial assumes that you have no familiarity with Rails and the command prompt whatsoever. If you've already got a bit of experience and you want to learn how to build something by following along with this tutorial, follow the discussion and wait for Episode 2.

Pilot: The Legend of Rails
-------------------------------
__________________________

A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away---no, that's not right. Let's go with something a bit more attractive.

*It was a dark and stormy nigh*---that's not right either. Let's just go with "once upon a time".

**Once upon a time,** there was a man named [David][David's website]. He was young-ish. He ran a business with a man named [Jason][LMGTFY: Jason Fried] called [37signals][] (now gone). 

  [David's website]: http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/
  [LMGTFY: Jason Fried]: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jason+fried
  [37signals]: https://37signals.com/

They looked down on what they had made---okay, enough with the biography. We'll just get to the point now. Then maybe a bit more of the story.

David, along with his friends at 37signals, created the awesome framework for webapps called [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). It's been around since 2003, and it's gotten better and better. I've used RoR 2.3.x, and it's a lot worse than the latest update line: 4.1.x. Both are pretty good, but for the sake of making a better app quicker, we'll be using Rails 4.1.1. Head over to <railsinstaller.org> if you're on Windows/OSX, grab a copy, and install. (It says 3.2, but it gave me 4.1.1 -- so I'm going to assume that's what you'll get too.) If you're on Linux, then look up instructions -- it could vary depending on your distribution (and I've never used Linux so I don't know how to install Rails on it).

Choose an editor to write your code in, and then in "Episode 1: Tales of The Command Prompt" we'll take a look around Rails and the command prompt (which you'll also learn about if you don't already know what it is).


Post-post note:
It's been said that Rails is dying. In ways, this holds truth; in others, it does not. Yes, the framework's userbase is growing smaller as more head for Node.js and other, newer server-side technologies. But even so, the core team works on it. People still make gems for it. Rails is still an amazing framework, and there's no reason why it should be gone because people favor Node or Hack or another framework more. Thanks for reading this post!
