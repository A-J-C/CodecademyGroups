We are here mainly to help make sure the Q&A forum is kept informative and friendly. For more info on us we have written a [blog post](http://www.codecademy.com/blog/65-meet-the-moderators) together. Currently we are writing more Blogs like the one on the [Linux Terminal](http://www.codecademy.com/blog/72-getting-comfortable-in-the-terminal-linux) by Daniel We have also written some blurbs so here they are:

[**AlbionsRefuge**][15] spends her days providing IT support to a wide variety of people at a Canadian university. She got hooked on coding back when PCs didn't use hard drives or come with Windows. Codecademy's growing number of languages and non-track content gives her an opportunity to learn at her own pace from more experienced people. She especially enjoys the Q & A section where she can help new coders get over the bumps and on their way.

[**Alex J**][2] is a Web developer and Ruby enthusiast from Germany. He graduated from the University of Leipzig in Linguistics and Computer science and has since developed a Web site for a linguistic research project.

He’s convinced that open learning platforms (see the huge popularity of Khan Academy, Coursera and others) represent the future of education – not just in programming.

[**Boring**][3] is a hobby coder from Germany, who has learned HTML & CSS some years ago. But this was not enough: One day he wanted to learn *programming*, so he decided to learn JavaScript. After several attempts he read about Codecademy, chose an uncreative name, learned programming here, found a great community and now he enjoys helping other coders.

[**criticizing monster**][21] has always had a thing for computers. This Swede started learning programming in order to cheat at grindy games and has since developed a taste for computer-aided problem solving. He enjoys pondering on the meaning of life and the human nature. It would probably be a good idea for him to go back to studying, starting with computer science and see where that takes him.

----------

[**Daniel Seymour**][14] first started coding because of Google Drive.  When he realized that Google Drive is highly functional if you know JavaScript, he decided to learn JavaScript.  After googling how to learn JavaScript, he found Codecademy and the rest is history.  Now in his spare time, he loves to mess around with his computer and help others learn to code.

[**Pedro Martins**][18] is a random guy from Portugal, born in 1989 that started programming a long time ago, in Warcraft III using JASS and vJASS. He had a dream of making a custom map that would immortalize his name in the WarCraft coding communities. Years passed by and he loved coding. His project did not become legend, but his tutorials in the community and his support eventually made him a reference for newcomers to learn from and after many years of work he finally got a chance to become a moderator. Unfortunatly he had to refuse that chance. By that time he had joined a University to learn how to better code, and he had no time. Still he felt like he had achieved something. Years passed by, and without his beloved WarCraft III communitites Pedro felt lost. There was no fire in his heart. That changed however when he discovered Codecademy. By that time Pedro was already taking the Majors degree in Computer Engineering, and he knew all to well not just how to code, but how to teach and reach people :P
