This post is now a bug reporting thread for any bugs you have found with the new UI. **Before posting a bug please check the list below** to make sure it has not already been reported, you can make suggestions on how to improve the new UI but be advised that these may not be implemented or read. The bugs however (hopefully) will.

Artur, feel free to use this post as a list of 'already reported and fixed, do x to fix' and 'working on fixing' kind of things.

Thanks,
Alonessix & AlexC
