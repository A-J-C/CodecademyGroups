This is a question we get asked a lot at our support forum and decided that the wonderful community here should share ideas here. So what would you recommend for a novice JS/Ruby/Python/HTML/or just all around generalist coder? Which programming book changed your life?

Dustin Goodman:
Every programmer should have a copy of *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen on their desk at home and desk at work. This is the best general theory CS book on the market in the opinion of some colleagues of mine and myself. It covers all CS theory in general terms that are applicable to all languages. A must buy if you ever see it. If you can get a PDF, I also recommend just leaving it on your desktop.

The C Programming Language (Second edition) 
By Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie

Data Abstraction and Structures using C++
By Mark R. Headington and David D. Riley
This book is good for learning about creating good program structure, and also about learning the C++ language if you don't already know it.

Gonzalo Vázquez:
For a greater started book into JavaScript I found this one to be very useful.
The Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke
As well the author provides a free HTML copy
