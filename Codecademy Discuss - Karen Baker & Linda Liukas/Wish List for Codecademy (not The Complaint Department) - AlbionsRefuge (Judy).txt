#### Here is the place for wishes - not bugs or complaints. 
Think about things you'd like to see added to or changed at Codecademy.  There is no plan to fulfill your wishes but it will be nice to have them all in one place instead of all over the site. If you see someone wishing for something please guide them here.

**If your wish is already here in this initial post**, DO NOT start a new response for it. Feel free to follow the link and add your +1 to the already existing response.

**If your wish is not here**, browse through the subsequent responses to see if your wish has been suggested by someone else. 

- **If you find it** then just add a new comment to it and place your vote by making the first two characters of your comment **+1** so that it will be easy to see. After that you may add any additional comments you feel are necessary.
- **If you do not find it** then new wishes should be posted as new responses. ONE wish per response so we can discuss and vote on it.

**In order to avoid a big mess**, please stay on topic and keep your comments attached to the right discussion. Out of place discussions and comments will be removed to preserve our sanity. Any +1 votes left in places other than as described above will be ignored. 

**BUGS** reported here will be deleted. If you have a bug to report - don't do it here! We DO want to hear about them, just NOT here. 
- [Exercise Bugs](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises)
- [Site Bugs](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/help-and-bug-reporting)

**New languages/courses** - please do not add these as wishes. Sorry, but they will just be deleted. There are hundreds of possibilities and they deserve a place of their own.

#### Wishes with +20 or better will be listed here:
