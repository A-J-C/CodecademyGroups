Today we're starting the rollout of Codecademy Discuss, a place for you to talk about programming, show off your skills, and learn from others, all in one forum. Codecademy is all about learning together and our community is full of helpful, clever people. 

As the community grows, we'll need help keeping it tidy, so we're also introducing moderation for the forums. Please meet our new moderators, which include the most active users of the site as well as Codecademy staff.

We work very hard to keep the conversation informative, supportive and fun for everyone. We will remove any comment or post that we feel is detrimental to this goal. You can help us by flagging inappropriate items, answering questions, and being all-around awesome. When in doubt, take a look at our [forum guidelines.][1] Moderators have the final say on what's allowed. 

**Codecademy moderators**

List will be updated!

[Minrice][2] started programming about a year ago, using online resources to teach himself some Python and PHP. Thanks to Codecademy, he now loves JavaScript and hopes to help others learn the language of the web.

[Alex][3] was born in Russia and lives in Germany, where he studies computer science but most just learns by doing. The friendly, active community and the culture of mutual teaching and helping is what he appreciates most about Codecademy.

[Dustin][4] is a professional software engineer from New Orleans. He graduated with his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Emory University and is obtaining a Masters of Science from Georgia Tech in Computer Engineering. Dustin works as a web developer when not in class and has a passion for school. One day he might become a university professor.

[Nico][5] lives in Belgium. He wants to help other young coders like himself while learning on the way.

[Marty McFly][6] is a homeschooler from Texas. Marty believes the best way to learn something is to teach it, and that belief has manifested itself in his work at Codecademy - the best place to learn *and teach* code. 

[Roy][7] hails from the age when a programmable calculator cost in real dollars what a decent laptop costs today. Technology of today's scale was then only the stuff of science fiction. A former theatre technician, he is a hobbyist computer enthusiast with a range of experience reaching back to early BASIC programming, early web development, and more recently web programming. He considers himself to be a 'lifelong learner' and enjoys helping others to keep learning, no matter what their age.

[NjeriChelimo][8] is a Ruby programmer from Nairobi, Kenya. She loves contributing to the programming community and sharing her knowledge with those around her. 

[Dory][9] is another Texan homeschooler. She prefers to learn by doing, which is one of the primary reasons she is such a big fan of Codecademy, as that is something they are all about.  Dory also loves seeing things "click" as people figure things out, and is always very happy to help people get to that point.

[Joseph][10] has been working with the Codecademy community as a beta tester since early 2012 and lives in northern Indiana. Transitioning from a career in education to one of software development, Joseph sees his involvement in Codecademy as a bridge between both worlds.

[Linda][11] is the Codecademy community manager and lives in New York. Originally from Finland (birthplace of Nokia, MySQL, Linux, SSH and IRC), Linda grew up surrounded by technology and now wants to help bring coding to everyone. 

[Eric][12] works on the Codecademy education team. His interests include Ruby, Python, and JavaScript (including jQuery, AJAX, JSON, and Node.js).

[Edditoria][13] works in product and brand marketing for 10+ years. He started programming by self-learning in Codecademy. "No more than 6 months, I can created a simple web app that helps people in daily life." said Edditoria. He loves to change things, create for people, and share happiness with everyone. Instead of `foobar`, he likes `pancake` and `donut` in coding.

In high school, [Michae][14]l was frustrated with the lack of a Computer Science curriculum and searched the Internet for a place to learn programming. After a long search, he found Codecademy to be the perfect oasis. Michael will be studying Computer Science at Princeton as part of the Class of 2017 and hopes to pursue a career in Ed-Tech.

*We're happy to answer any questions you may have about moderation policies via e-mail. Please e-mail us at moderators (at) codecademy (dot) com. If you want to become a moderator, please contact Linda for more details at linda (a) codecademy (dot) com.*
