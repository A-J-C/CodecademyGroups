Hello,
this post provides a collection of challenges, which have been created by users to challenge other users and to learn from other's solutions, as they should be shared in the QA forums.

If you want to create challenges or remember some challenges you have done or even created at CC, let me know and I'll add it in this list.

It would be great, if there were some people creating challenges for Ruby.
And it would be great, if you completed the challenges and posted the solutions in the QA forums of the challenges, so others can learn from your code.
So, start coding. :-)
