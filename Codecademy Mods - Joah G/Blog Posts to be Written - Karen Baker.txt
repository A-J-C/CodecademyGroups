Hey everyone,

This is to continue the conversation around possible blog posts in a semi-organized way. I guess let's start by listing out topics people want to see and then claiming them? Then when we have an idea around authors we can think about timing, calendars and how to keep it going. :) 

**EDIT: We now have a [Google Doc spreadsheet][1] to keep track of possible post topics, gather & learn from other people's post topics, and list projects to potentially feature from the community. Please help fill out and bring to life!**

----------

### Personal stories

**Background**

 - "How I learned to code" type posts similar to [Codecademy Stories][2].
 - Inspires users to learn and offers resources, advice and encouragement. 
 - Also great for explaining how to get started on different career paths, e.g. how to become a developer or how to use Python at work or for a project

**Volunteers for personal stories:** 

*[Add yourself here if you want to write one! Then maybe later link to a draft in the comments?]*
Michael Rochlin - How to learn programming beyond Codecademy. (I'd like some guidance here on what is ok to reference and what isn't. For example, I assume MDN or StackOverflow are ok, but what about Coursera/Khan Academy etc which are in some ways competitors...)
Dustin Goodman - Choosing between Computer Science and Computer Engineering and learning to code through the university system.
Nick Edwards - A beginner's foray into coding at work: "Why wait for someone to fix something when you can fix it yourself?"
