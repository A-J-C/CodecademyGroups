Hello and welcome to the mods group! If you're reading this you are one of the selected few chosen from the community to help make it a better place! **Well done**, you must be doing a brilliant job!

Before you dive into reading every mod discussion here (highly recommended) these are a few key posts it would be great if you could contribute to and read through.

-------

 + Not quite sure what a moderator is or want to learn best practices, see Dustin's [**moderator guidelines**](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/50be1cea39df7f453d0001a2).

 + Want to **introduce yourself**? Then write your personal blurb [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/516f5ea4ad5643e38f002459)
 + Also make sure you add yourself to this list [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/5154625964c6848e7f003841).
 + Any **questions**? Create a post or check out [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/518b0d36539f7a11490027c3).

 + Wondering **when** all of the Mods became Mods? [check here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/524c7d1d80ff33d32b00576a) and also **add yourself** to the bottom. Add yourself and **timezone** [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/5154625964c6848e7f003841) as well!

 + Found a rude or **inappropriate user**? Add them to this list [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/50c9f2ebe89b7a02be0002c7) so we can keep an eye on them or ban them.
 + Know a **great user** that would make a good moderator? Then mention them [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/515458421672cf3e02003714) and add them to this nice [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AldJ7vHsMI_0dHFoYWdsVm01bmlQOWZ3ZUxrQVNSclE&usp=sharing), while checking out the spreadsheet make sure you +1 any existing potential mods on the list you want to see here!
 + Have a cool **suggestion** to improve our time as moderators mention it [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/5263b59bf10c604fc500fc4f).
 + Know a **good beta course** you want to see promoted to a non track course? Add it on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmiUmzXzpa1ddE13WEhKeVowYlBGSU1FeXYzWV9EOEE&usp=sharing) and checck [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/5263b696548c35a575010733) post out.
 + Want to write a **blog post** for the illustrious [CC Blog](http://www.codecademy.com/blog) then check out [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/51a6747a8c14182c59001e16) post and [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/51706f70e7ecd0a4eb000074) one.
 + Another concern for people that post a lot of answers in the Q&A is that they are **downvoted** a lot. Dont feel disheartened it [happens](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/518e8f4d384efadffb002fac) to all of us. Its part and parcel of being a mod some people just dont like our help.
 + Need to view an **SCT**? Theres a [post](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/535b1fdc8c1cccad7100079b) for that.
 + Want to help **combat bugs**? If you're not in the groups already have a look at [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/515455dc432c0a33b1003380).
 + Want an easy way to **answer questions** on Q&A then go [here](https://github.com/sharocko/codecademy-mods). Dont forget once you have answered a question, or seen someone else answer it well to go back on the list and click 'actions' then 'hide from list' on the appropriate question.

 + There are many questions that ask similar things. For these questions we have created a repository on GitHub to keep a lot of nice answers in one place. [Check](https://github.com/sharocko/codecademy-mods) it out and if you can add to it.

 + We have done a few courses and challenges outside of CC so if you have found a course and want some of us to go through it with you then feel free to make a new post or you can see if theres any updates to this [**Coursera**](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/524892ee80ff3341d4002f2b) thread.

 + Joah has made some awesome **bookmarklets** [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/51e9b4c7282ae31a12000382) that he has also turned into **Chrome Extensions** which are linked to within the post. These make it easier to ban people and fix some site bugs. 

 + The one bookmarklet/chrome extension that is a must is the **Ban User button** which you can get [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/525f49b2abf821bdd700084c). If you don't use chrome you can get the bookmarklet from [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/51e9b4c7282ae31a12000382) thread instead.

 + If you want to see more information about a user, you can see there **user history** from anyone's profile page. Hannah wrote about it [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/521bb583548c357530000006).

 + Add yourself to the [time app](http://ccmodstimeapp.herokuapp.com/), quite a few mods are on it and it's a neat thing to look at some times. To add yourself login under 'admin' the username is "ccmod13" and the password "domcc13".

 + There are more **Extensions** listed [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/5368097152f863a7090010b5).

 + If you want to vent your **frustrations** anywhere hopefully they will be heard [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/536beb4680ff334df7000082).

 + And check what's coming up on CC [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/536beb4d7c82cad4d300005f).

 + **Increase your efficiency** with [ProKeys](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prokeys/ekfnbpgmmeahnnlpjibofkobpdkifapn), that lets you define custom snippets and retrieve when desired. Custom snippets of answers thus can be made. Here's [a guide of what can be achieved using it](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-mods/discussions/53aaa33e7c82ca5a0300271b).

---------

#### Tools / Tips

Lazarus: Form Recovery - an add-on for Chrome, Firefox, Safari. This periodically saves what you type in any form box. It will reduce the chances of "ARRRGGG" when something happens in the middle of typing a long explanation, etc.

Linkclump: - an add-on for Chrome. Right click and drag to select and open multiple links. Comes in handy on "Recent Questions", "Recent Answers", the Q&A or Group discussion lists pages and User History pages.

Searching: searching Q&A and Groups on this site is not working very well, hopefully this will change but until it does: To search Q&A use Google site search. https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acodecademy.com+-forums+"Next+Steps+(RPS)". This is not good for recent stuff because Google hasn't crawled it yet. It will not work for Groups because only logged in users can get into Groups so Google can't crawl it at all.

----------

If after a week from when you have been made a mod you are still not a co-leader in every kept group and you can't use any of the tools listed above then make sure you nag people through email as you should have access to all these tools that make being a moderator a lot easier.

----------


Finally don't be intimidated by us. We are all just **humans**! Feel free to ask any questions here no matter how silly you think it may seem.
And remember have **fun**!

Thanks for reading,
Alex
