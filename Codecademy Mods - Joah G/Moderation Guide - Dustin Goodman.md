Welcome to the Codecademy Moderator&rsquo;s Guide. This will tell you the ins and outs of your powers on the Q&A forums and layout your expectations and responsibilities. If you have any questions once done reading or feel there is a mistake in the document, email the moderator group at moderators@codecademy.com. Let&rsquo;s get started! :)

Can't find something?  Look on this list of [Key Moderator Materials][1].

### What can Moderators do?

 1. You can see the overall activity on the Q&A forums and the recent questions posted on each track through your moderator panel at http://www.codecademy.com/admin/forums/qa. You can also get to that by clicking on your "Me" icon and choosing "Moderator". This currently shows the most  **Recent Questions** from the JavaScript, Web Fundamentals and jQuery tracks as well as the **Recent Answers** from all of the tracks. If you want to view a specific track, add a `/[track_name]` to the end of the URL above, i.e. if you want to view Ruby questions, use http://www.codecademy.com/admin/forums/qa/ruby

 2. You can edit and delete Q&A posts. Note that removing a question removes all of its answers, and when an answer is removed, so are all associated comments as well so be careful because there currently is not a way to recover deleted posts.

 3. Moderators have been made co-leaders of all of the public Groups which allows you to edit and delete posts. The culture varies from one group to another so we usually leave the moderating of Groups to the "real" co-leaders, the ones who hang out and participate in the group. An exception would be any explicit, hate, homophobic, etc. posts. Those can be removed as soon as you find them. Note the situation on the [watch list][2].

 4. You can look at a user's questions/answers/comments/flags history either by going to their Profile page and using the **User History** button or you can [search for a user][3]. You can also see the date they joined CC and their email address. We don't have a policy in place yet but we generally do not email users directly.

In your Moderator's Panel you can also find buttons to:

 1. Look at **Users** data (number of up/down votes received, answers, questions asked, flags received, etc.), direct link:  http://www.codecademy.com/admin/forums/users. From this user data page, you can also email or ban specific users. It is quite clunky to page through looking for your user so use the "Ban a User" [bookmarklet][4] if you ever get to the point of needing to ban someone, 

 2. Look at **Flags** to see questions and answers that have been flagged, direct link:  http://www.codecademy.com/admin/forums/flags. This is also clunky and pretty much useless because you can't sort or search it - a replacement has been talked about so that may appear at some point.

 3. Look at **Courses**. This one is relatively new and hasn't been explained to us fully yet. These are user made courses that are in varying stages of readiness. [A discussion on these][5].

  
### The Moderation Policy and Philosophy

Moderation means removing unhelpful comments, but also it also means amplifying voices that should be heard. The aim is to moderate as little as possible, but as the community is young, we want to steer the discussion to be as helpful as possible. Our users are here to learn and we are here to help them have fun while they are doing that.

If you encounter any examples of good community culture like [this thread][6] then forward it on to community@codecademy.com. These help CC show and tell the story of what we do here.

1. **no fighting** :) You were invited to become a moderator because you already exhibited a talent for explaining things to people so you probably don't need this advice - but here it is anyway. Don't argue or engage with an angry user. As in any social situation you will run into a wide variety of personalities, not all of them easy going. You also may encounter someone who is currently experiencing something in their lives that is medical, emotional or in some way traumatic. Give them the benefit of the doubt and imagine that to be the case. It won't hurt if their post goes unanswered for a while - take a break, breathe, come back later or talk it over with the rest of us at moderators@codecademy.com.  Here is [an example of a user that is beyond reason][7].  Here is an [example of a misunderstanding][8], learning happened on both sides of the conversation that day.

1. **make it fun** We work very hard to keep the conversation informative, supportive and fun - we will remove any comment or post that we feel is harmful to this goal. Moderators have the final say on what&#39;s allowed.

2. **leave your name** When you edit a user's questions or answers, it&#39;s generally good to give an explanation and link your name to a comment explaining what you've done. You can also refer them to Alex&rsquo;s post on [How to format code in Q&amp;A forums][9]  and to Masoud's [animated gif on that same subject][10] in your addendum.

3. **set a good example** Demonstrate patience &amp; fairness toward all learners. The aim is to moderate as little as possible, but as the community is young, we want to steer the discussion to be as helpful as possible.

5. **tidy up** Edit posts that need help. Pure spam you can just remove. If you find a post that might need some formatting or a tiny bit of grammar help, you should feel free to help the user out and edit their post accordingly. Just make sure you note any major changes you make in a comment at the bottom of the post. Sometimes it's better to repost all or part of their code in your answer and format it there. That shows off the before/after difference.

Moderation policies shouldn&#39;t be discussed in the forums. If you are concerned about something, please e-mail moderators@codecademy.com and we can think the case through together.

### Case Studies
#### Spam  
We&rsquo;ve all seen it. We all know what it is, but when should we delete it?
( this section needs examples, try to keep it in mind and add them when you find them )

1. If it&rsquo;s clearly spam, don&rsquo;t think. Just delete. ![example of spam][11]

2. General rule of thumb though, if it looks like spam and smells like spam, then it&rsquo;s probably spam. Flag the user then just delete it and move on with your life. If a user gets enough flags and we&rsquo;ll investigate further in regards to spam. If you see someone posting multiple threads and they&rsquo;re all spam and they won&rsquo;t stop, feel free to ban them as well. There currently isn&rsquo;t a fantastic way to do this manually, but Michael Tackes (minrice2099) is working on a solution for this so hang on!

3. Much Needed Redirection  
       ![This thread needs help!][12]  
	This is an example of a post where the user needs some redirection and better understanding of how to ask a more appropriate answer. The following response and actions are more than appropriate:  
       ![alt text][13]

4. An Iffy Example  
         ![alt text][14]  
	This is a case where you have two possible responses. One inclination is to just delete it as spam and move on. The second option is to redirect the user&rsquo;s question and help them understand why their question is bad and inform them of deletion much like in case (b). Because each of us would handle this situation differently, discretion is left to the first moderator to respond to the post.

#### Behavior

**Inappropriate Language**
If someone puts inappropriate language in a post, it is preferred to remove the inappropriate word and edit the users’ comment or response to still make sense but without the language. You should also leave a note at the bottom saying, “Edited by <insert your name>: removed inappropriate language”. If the inappropriate language is in a comment, you really don’t have a choice but to delete it and there are currently no ways to inform the user as to why. Now, there are some ambiguous cases for this moderation as well. Most of these revolve around the name of some programming languages. The one that comes to mind is “Brainf***”. Although a language, it really isn’t necessary to say it on the forums unless someone is actually asking for a challenging Turing-like language in which case its 100% applicable. Please use discretion when moderating these types of posts. 

[example 01][15]
 
Unless excessive these don't need to be added to the [watch list][16].

**Unhelpful Comments/Posts**
The Forum Guidelines specifically ask that users be as helpful as possible without just giving away answers. Hence, if an answer is lacking or just doesn't quite have a place in the current topic, feel free to remove or request that the user improve upon their previous answer. This request should be encouraging, along the lines of "It's great to see you helping out, to help even more ... ".

Unless excessive these don't need to be added to the [watch list][17].

**Rude Comments**
There is a fine line difference between rude and commenting on a poorly written exercise. [This post][18] is a perfect example of comments that reflect on a poorly written exercise. They aren't written to tear down the course creator but rather look to encourage him/her to improve upon their course as it really did not help the novice users. There was plenty of great commentary and discussion in order to help improve the jQuery track. Now, if a post comes up and is like, “I hate Eric Weinstein” (this post has existed more than once in various Q&A forums) but has plenty of reasons the user doesn't like Eric’s lessons, this post requires some moderation to make it more polite. Change the name of the post to be non-offensive and remove any offensive remarks within the post. Leave a message for the user to revise their post due to rude comments. 

Genuinely rude, repeat offenders should be added to the [watch list][19].

**Hate, racist, homophobic, explicit, etc. content**
Note the user so you can add them to the [watch list][20]. Flag each post. Use the **User History** button in their profile to track down all instances - these ones tend to go on a spree. Delete all traces, don't bother to leave them a message, they are seeking attention and acknowledging their existence will encourage them to continue. If they are posting a lot and don't seem to be stopping you can use the "Ban a User" [bookmarklet][21] or if you aren't sure what to do you can email moderators@codecademy.com and someone will help out as soon as they can.

**Posting Answers as Questions (thread starters)**
You will see a few users just posting answers to a lesson as the first post in a thread in the Q&A forums. This is unacceptable behavior. Please flag this user. Often they will do this in several places in a short period of time. Remove their posts except for one. You can check their "User History" to find these. On this single post, edit the post to no longer contain the answer and leave a note saying why you've edited. Then, write a note for the user telling them how you are happy that they are willing to spend their time helping out and that giving new coders an explanation will help them learn more. This often does the trick. 

If the behaviour continues add them to the [watch list][22], add a short note/date and delete this round of posts - this is like strike 2. If it continues we can consider a ban.  

There are some examples of these where there are very detailed explanations included. These usually appear because that lesson was tough or not explained well. Generally posts with a high level of quality can be left.

Sometimes you will get to one of these and it has an error - feel free to help them fix their mistakes. Sometimes by the time you find it the conversation has developed in to something worth keeping so use your discretion and keep it if you feel it has merit. 

**Posting Answers that are just code**
Users posting code that is **well documented** in order to help another user solve a problem or better understand the problem is perfectly acceptable. Undocumented answers that are just code can be dealt with as above. Encouraging these people to post better answers can end up creating more helpers for us!
[example 01 - see laurentiis][23]

### Questions/Suggestions about course content
From time to time a user will take the time to give us some good feedback on a lesson's content, [here is an example][24]. Or they may ask how to give feedback. Have them post in the Q&A Forum closest to the topic they are commenting on. You should send the link to their feedback on to community@codecademy.com and someone from CC will reach out to them and take any other steps they feel is appropriate.

### Feedback/Suggestions about translation
July 9, 2014: [Nik](mailto:nikhil@codecademy.com) said *"... always happy to hear feedback which I can pass along to Leng and Rachel who are now leading our translation efforts."*

### Buggy Exercises and Site Bugs
Be on the alert for these. People tend to report them in the Q&A forums and then 10 others chime in. Often they don't know that there are good places to report these issues. You could tell them about the [Buggy Exercises][25] group or the group for [Site Bugs][26] but often they won't follow up. It's best to get these problems reported and looked ASAP. You can post the issue yourself and leave a reference link back to the Q&A post and then post the bug link in the Q&A forum - that way everything is tied together. 

Sometimes the problem is new and is causing a lot of trouble. You can pin a post in the Q&A, either one that has already been started or a new one, that refers to the bug and the bug report. Give it a headline like *"[reported] Bug is eating all the code. "* When the bug is fixed you can change that to [fixed] and unpin it.

### User profiles
If you find any explicit, racist, homophobic, etc. profile pictures, user names, comments within a user's profile or links within a user's profile send an email to  community@codecademy.com with a link to the user profile. Someone from CC with either contact them to change it or delete as seems appropriate.
