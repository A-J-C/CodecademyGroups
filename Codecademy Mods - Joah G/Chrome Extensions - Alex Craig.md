With the update to the new UI several more Chrome Extensions have been made to improve the site and fix functionality. I have made these 3 :

[Group UI Updater](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecademy-group-ui-updat/bladgjamjaiaffkojoadgeelkgfgkdkp) - Gives the group a new look matching the new style of CC.
[SCT Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecademy-sct-viewer/aomhngakklnijmbfboppjgmfpibogbga) - Adds a 'show sct' button to all exercises.
[Profile Updater](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecademy-profile-update/obkificipphimkfnabogonnokbapcoga) - Adds more information to people's profiles.

Joah has made a Ban Extension which works but there are a few glitches causing people to get banned so I will wait till Artur or Leng help Joah with the API calls to fix the glitch before posting a link there.

*Maybe someday these could be integrated into CC fully but until then enjoy the extensions ...*

Future ones:

Mod Page Revamp - I can re-style it but some features I would like to implement depend on if I can figure out how to make the forum questions paginated on the main page and how to add Ruby and other languages to the main page. A lot of this page is broken anyway but at least it will be broken in style.
UserHistory Page Revamp - Improving the styling of that so there's less scrolling and it's easier to find things.
