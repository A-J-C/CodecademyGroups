Hey everyone,

Yesterday we had a thread titled "Who here is under 13?" in Advanced Web Developers — We haven't had a very clear policy of what to do when we come across someone under 13, and (after speaking to our legal person) I wanted to clarify.

 1. If you see a thread or comment where a user reveals their age as under 13, **note of their username and post it with a link below.** I will reach out to them and explain that we will need to delete their account, and they will have 24 hours to save any data. 
 2. Then **remove the comment and leave a response** explaining that users must be 13 or over to be on Codecademy. 

Hope that helps, and it sucks we have to do it this way but until we come up with a formal plan this is the next best thing. : / 

Thanks!
