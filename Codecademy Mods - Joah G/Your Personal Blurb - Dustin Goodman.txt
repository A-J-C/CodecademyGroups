Hey folks,

Michael's post about the blog post brought up an important point. We don't have personal blurbs for everyone yet. Before Groups, we had a welcome post on the discuss forum that welcomed all the users to Codecademy and introduced all the moderators. That post still exists [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-discuss/discussions/50e61b2d503c043c2a00020b) but is clearly out of date. If you guys don't mind taking a minute or two to write a quick blurb about yourself that would be awesome. Things that would be great are the following:

 - Where are you from?
 - How long have you been coding?
 - What is your favorite language?
 - What is your coding experience?

These are just a few guiding ideas. I'll compile them all into a new post to update that out of date one. Mine is below for anyone looking for a guiding example.

update: this list should be copied over to [Welcome! Meet the Mods!](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-discuss/discussions/51aa17d4f77d620a7700018c) 

----------

[**AlbionsRefuge**][1] spends her days providing IT support to a wide variety of people at a Canadian university. She got hooked on coding back when PCs didn't use hard drives or come with Windows. Codecademy's growing number of languages and non-track content gives her an opportunity to learn at her own pace from more experienced people. She especially enjoys the Q & A section where she can help new coders get over the bumps and on their way.

----------

[**Alex C**][2] is a teenage coding enthusiast! He started learning to code in an after school programming group at his secondary school at the start of Year 7. With help from his friends learning with him he managed to build up his knowledge of Java through books and other online courses. He is currently taking GCSE computing science and will carry on learning to code throughout his time at school. He has learnt a lot of JavaScript and Python from CC and loves helping people to put something back in the community.

------------

[**Boring**][3] is a hobby coder from Germany, who has learned HTML & CSS some years ago. But this was not enough: One day he wanted to learn *programming*, so he decided to learn JavaScript. After several attempts he read about Codecademy, chose an uncreative name, learned programming here, found a great community and now he enjoys helping other coders.

----------

[**Clarisse (chalisi)**][4] is a French woman from the INSA of Rennes in computer engineering. She only started to coding in first year of higher education with the horrible functional language "scheme", then Java.

She began to learn web development in MOOC like Codecademy and know object-oriented, functional and logical programming languages from her school.

----------
[**criticizing monster**][5] has always had a thing for computers. This Swede started learning programming in order to cheat at grindy games and has since developed a taste for computer-aided problem solving. He enjoys pondering on the meaning of life and the human nature. It would probably be a good idea for him to go back to studying, starting with computer science and see where that takes him.

----------

[**Daniel Seymour**][6] first started coding because of Google Drive.  When he realized that Google Drive is highly functional if you know JavaScript, he decided to learn JavaScript.  After googling how to learn JavaScript, he found Codecademy and the rest is history.  Now in his spare time, he loves to mess around with his computer and help others learn to code.

-----------

[**Gaurang Tandon**][10] is a teenager who did not know even what programming was,what he just knew was a basic knowledge of BASIC.But in the days when he could not find any new flash games to play,he decided to research the internet on where to learn HTML and bumped by Codecademy,finding it the most interactive.Now , he aims to become someone in which he can use his knowledge of programming. Gaurang can speak Hindi and English with ease and has a intermediate mastery of  JScript,Python,Ruby,HTML and CSS.

----------

[**Giacomo Sorbi**][11] marketing and IT consultant currently located in Italy, his love with programming had ups and downs since when he started coding with AmOS for his old Amiga 500. Time passed, he went on to study Business&Administration, Marketing and other Economics subjects, but computers and software kept following and charming him. Formerly a total self-taught coder, now he has started honing his skills with both web development and Python programming.

----------

[**Glenn Richard**][12] lives on Long Island, NY, USA, where he teaches about energy and natural sciences.  He first learned coding back in the days when programs were submitted to a mainframe on punch cards, and output as well as error messages arrived on big sheets of green and white paper.  His favorite programming languages are Python, Java, Ruby, and Lisp.  Other interests include hiking, music, politics, technology, sustainability, the seashore, the Adirondacks, New York City, and anything concerning how the world functions from a social or natural perspective.

----------

[**Haley Higgins**][13] is a 17-year-old Texan teen who can’t resist a joke or writing code.  About 400 cyber years ago, when she was 13, she started learning to code with the assistance of some /\* very outdated \*/ library books.  When, at the prompting of a friend, she joined Codecademy, she fell in love with the simple-to-use platform and now thoroughly enjoys freelancing as a frontend-er (primarily using HTML, CSS, plus a bit of jQuery) and assisting others as they make their way into the wonderful world of code.

----------

[**Jacob Andersen**][14] is a code-hobbyist and education-lover from California, United States. He learned to code when he was about 12 years old and has been going ever since. When he joined Codecademy, he fell in love with its ease of use and nice design. Ever since, he has loved Codecademy and helped to keep it the best it could be. His favorite programming language is Java, and he always chooses Java where it is applicable. A second choice is PHP, a runner-up favorite. He is currently learning how to use Ruby on Rails and other microframeworks based on it to make web applications in Ruby. Jacob is currently 17 years old.

His favorite web technologies are the awesomeness that is PHP, Zurb's Foundation Framework (love it) and the usefulness of MySQL.  He hopes to one day get formal training in web technologies and utilize those new superpowers for good!

----------

[**Lucien Cooper**][19] is a BSc Computer Science student at the University of Leicester and loves to both learn and teach code. He's been coding for about a year now and he'd say his favourite language is Ruby because it is so fun, however he came from a Java background and enjoys making code as simple and powerful as possible. He came across Codecademy by chance and has been here ever since because he loves the community here and has learnt some new languages to further his knowledge and skills.

----------

[**Michael Rochlin**][20] is a future software engineer who was abroad in Israel and has now returned to his beloved New Jersey (Juy-zey).

Nick hopes to combine his passion for politics and computing into a PhD.

-----------

[**Nico Ekkart**][22] is a high school student and hobby coder from Belgium. He started learning to code at the age of 11, by making simple websites with HTML, CSS and PHP. Then, he found codecademy and was instantaneously in love with the learn-by-doing way. He learned Javascript, jQuery, Python and Ruby on codecademy, but python is definitely his favourite language. He's currently studying Latin-Maths, but hopes to study computer science at the University of Antwerp.

----------

[**Pedro Martins**][23] is a random guy from Portugal, born in 1989 that started programming a long time ago, in Warcraft III using JASS and vJASS. He had a dream of making a custom map that would immortalize his name in the WarCraft coding communities. Years passed by and he loved coding. His project did not become legend, but his tutorials in the community and his support eventually made him a reference for newcomers to learn from and after many years of work he finally got a chance to become a moderator. Unfortunatly he had to refuse that chance. By that time he had joined a University to learn how to better code, and he had no time. Still he felt like he had achieved something. Years passed by, and without his beloved WarCraft III communitites Pedro felt lost. There was no fire in his heart. That changed however when he discovered Codecademy. By that time Pedro was already taking the Majors degree in Computer Engineering, and he knew all to well not just how to code, but how to teach and reach people :P

----------
