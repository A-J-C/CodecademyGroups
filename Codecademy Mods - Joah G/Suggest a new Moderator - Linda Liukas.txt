As you guys have seen we're adding some new people to the group. We've been *very* selective in moderator choices, looking for people who are trusted and liked among the community, but show a good judgement in solving conflicts. You guys form the culture of the community. 

As the community is growing there are lots of things we're prepping for you moderators, related to the tools and tasks (and perks!) we can offer you. In order to sustainably grow the mod group, your experience and recommendations are invaluable. We're especially looking for three types of mods:

 * Moderator candidates from different language groups. We already have multi-lingual mods, but if you run across good candidates who speak chinese, brazilian portuguese or russian, please let us know. 
 * Moderator candidates in different timezones. Codecademy is very global and our mod pool should reflect that. 
 * Moderator candidates who have a strong passion to a certain language. One of the things we'll be doing in future is giving more tools for language tracks/projects and mastery (and willingess to help others learn) in a certain language is always a plus.
