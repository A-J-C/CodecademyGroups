Hi all,

Just want to let you know that you can now access the new tool that allows moderators to gain a more holistic sense of a user's activity on the site. Please keep in mind that if you're viewing people with a lot of history (like you), it might be a little bit slow. For most users, this won't be the case though.

There are two ways you can access it:
1. Go to www.codecademy.com/admin/user_present and enter a username. 
2. Click on the "View History" button from a user's profile.

Let me know if you find any problems. If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear from you! I'll be reaching out again in the next couple days about future projects.

Thanks!

Hannah
