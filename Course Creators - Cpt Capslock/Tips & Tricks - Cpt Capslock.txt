When you first start creating courses, it's helpful to know roughly what the best way to present and teach things are. Here is where you can share all of what you know about course creation.

Here are some of mine:

 - Know what you're teaching

  
> Before you start teaching, you should feel comfortable using what you're trying to teach others.
> For instance, it would better for me to make a Ruby course then a Lisp course, because I am more comfortable coding Ruby than Lisp.

- If you're continuing another course, you will want to make a review. You will also want to end courses with a review.

> Without reviews, it will be difficult for the student to remember what he has already learned, unless he's practiced quite a bit.

 - Teach by example

> Without an example, it's sometimes difficult to understand what the teacher is teaching. For example, what would you rather see:
> 1. When you run code, variables, strings, and numbers can be printed to console. You can do so like this:

    console.log("string");

> or
> 2. You can print things to the console using `console.log()`. You just add a string between the parentheses and click Save & Submit Code.

Feel free to ask about any of these tips or tricks, and to add your own!
