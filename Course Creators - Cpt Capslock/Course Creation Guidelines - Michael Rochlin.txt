Hey guys. I'm working on developing some course writing guidelines that will ensure that the quality of courses is very high. Here are a few things that you should keep in mind when writing courses:

 1. SCTs (Submission Correctness Tests) must be extremely rigorous. It should always catch ALL errors and exceptions. I'm working on a few good templates for writing SCTs, but remember that this is one of the most important parts of the course.

 2. Your course should follow proper style conventions for the language you are using. There are many conventions for Javascript, but remember to be consistent with naming conventions, whitespace etc. In Ruby, we definitely prefer that you follow one of the "Unofficial Style Guides", which you can find via Google. Again, consistency is very important. For Python, any course that does not follow [PEP 8][1] **must** be fixed. PHP style is also less strict, but must be consistent. Any future languages added must follow style guides if they exist or must be consistent if they don't.

 3. Your course must be in well written, understandable English (or another language if you are involved in that.) If you are not a native English speaker and would like help editing your course, just ask for help.

 4. SCTs should return as helpful an error message as possible. If the user code results in an Exception, the full text of the Exception should be included in the message.

Here is a list of things to think about when writing your course:

The following are simple YES/NO
 - Does the default code and
   instructions follow proper style
   conventions?
 - Does the lesson present proper coding
   techniques?
 - Will a professional engineer smile
   at the sight of the code?
 - Are the instructions well written
   (stylistically, not content)?
 - Does it use proper grammar and have
   good writing style?

The following are more complex, but equally important:

 - Does the lesson attempt to teach
   anything of value?
 - Does the lesson successfully teach
   anything of value?
 - Does the lesson reinforce what it
   teaches (ie is there practice and
   review)?
 - Is the SCT well designed? Will it
   catch ALL reasonable mistakes? Will
   it return helpful error messages?
 - Is the instructional text (ie the
   learning part) clear? Does it
   actually teach what it wants to?
 - Are the instructions (ie what to do)
   clear? Is there room for
   misinterpretations?
 - Is there room for multiple valid
   answers and will those answers be
   accepted?
 - Will the user come out of the lesson
   having learned something?
 - Will they actually know what they
   learned and be able to use it?

If you want help and or feedback or have further improvements to this list, let me know.
