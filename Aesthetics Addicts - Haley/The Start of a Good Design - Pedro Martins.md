I know I am probably to late, but to design overall good inerfaces you should have some principles in mind:

Other things in mind should also be the golden rules of interface design:

There are also other sets of rules, but if you handle these fine than you made an acceptable job. 

Once you have memorized these rules making them part of your life, the next step is making mockups and prototypes. Depends on what you want to do, but when I design web apps for Android phones I use balsamiq:

There are other online tools such as:

Let me make this clear: mockups are part of an iterative process. They are not meant to be your interface, they are meant to be an attempt. They are simple and easy to make so you can test them with users as much as possible and change them as much as possible. Using mockups means you plan on having users testing your app and that you plan on changing the app based on the feedback they give you.

Once you have your mockup stable (when all testers agree that it is acceptable or have no more suggestions) you can go to the art work, and beauty of the site, using your artistic values (as I learned mockups are mainly about simplicity and functionality).

Anyway, these are the basic rules I learned in my classes. Hope it helps.
