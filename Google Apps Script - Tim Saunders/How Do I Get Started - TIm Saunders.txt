That's a good question. Here's three simple steps to get you on your feet:

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: this group is *not* aimed at developing mobile apps for either Android or iOS. 'Apps' in this context refers to the Google Suite of Applications eg Gmail, Drive, Calendar etc.**

 1. If you've not already worked through the [Codecademy JavaScript Track][1] then that's first on your to do list. If you have - congratulations, you're already well on the way!
 2. Your second job is to take a glance at the excellent [Google Apps Script Documentation][2]. The '[Your first script][3]' tutorial will introduce you to the script editor and walk you through creating a simple *Hello World* function. Does that syntax seem familiar? Of course it does! It's just JavaScript after all. (Note, you'll need to [create a Google account][4] if you don't already have one). The specifics of the things we'll be learning are covered under [Default Services][5] - don't worry that there's quite a lot there!
 3. Finally, you've probably used the helpful [Codecademy JavaScript Glossary][6] but you might not have checked out the more comprehensive [Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript Documentation][7] which they've put a handy link to. Bookmark it, it's great!

If you've got this far then you're ready to put your JavaScript to good use and you're armed with all the tools you're going to need!
