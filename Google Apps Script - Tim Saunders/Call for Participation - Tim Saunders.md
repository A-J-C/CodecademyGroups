**Hi everyone**

Thanks for taking the time to stop by this little group and I hope that some of you will have given some of the tutorials a go and benefited from this little introduction to Google Apps Script. It would be great to get some feedback from a few more people - **the group has lots of members but not many of you are posting** so it's difficult to know how you feel about all this. **Speak you minds!** Unfortunately some of the comments and conversations that did exist were affected by the database upgrade a few weeks back - sorry if that's you.

**Please get involved**

I wish I had more time to create content for this group but work and other commitments often get in the way. I'm also trying to learn some other languages at the same time! 

This is where I need your help. **Do you have some ideas for small projects that you could break up in to small chunks, add some explanation and share with the community?** It would be great to hear from you if you'd like to get involved - either comment below or **tweet me ([@sauntimo][1])** and we'll work something out.
