We're going to take a look at how you can manipulate data the people submit in to a Google form. They're really easy to set up and have lots of great real-life applications. You probably don't need a tutorial to set up a Google form, but humour me and have a go just so you're familiar with how it works.

 1. Go to [drive.google.com][1] and log in.
 2. Click *Create* and then *Form*.

 3. Set up some questions! You'll automatically be started off with two, but you can add more by clicking on *Add Item*, top left.

**Points to consider when setting up questions**
* Who will be responding? Make sure they understand what you want from them
* Questions in which respondents choose an option mean that you know what the possible answers are going to be. This may be helpful when you're writing a script based on the results.
* Open ended questions (Text or Paragraph Text) allow any text input. If you need a particular type of result like a date, email address or phone number it is impossible to stop users from entering invalid responses. You may need to address this in your script.

I have set a up a test form which collects respondent's favourite colour and invites them to give a bit of an explanation. You can see the [live form][5] (and add your responses!) and the [results][6].

Whenever you create a Google form, it is attached to a spreadsheet which collects all the submissions. This spreadsheet behaves like most other spreadsheets you've seen and we'll be doing some cooler stuff with the submissions soon.
