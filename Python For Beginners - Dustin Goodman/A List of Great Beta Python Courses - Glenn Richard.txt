**Last Updated: April 15, 2014**

The following list includes nearly all the Codecademy Python courses that offer badges upon completion, but which are neither part of the main Python track nor the set of API courses.  Most of them have not been officially published, but they will give you a chance to practice and enhance your Python programming skills. Have fun!

If you have gone through all the Python courses that are written in English, and would like to try some parallel Python material that is done in Spanish, go to [Bootcamps de Apps.co (original)](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/appsco_original) or [Bootcamps de Apps.co](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/appsco).  There, you'll also find courses that cover other coding languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to Python. The latter includes added material, such as courses on Ruby, also written in Spanish.

Referring to the list of hyperlinks, above ...

Codecademy's Python track is great, and so is the content offered by the various Python groups, especially this one.  But, there are over 100 Codecademy Python courses beyond the main Python track.

The material listed above ranges in its degree of testing and refinement, but it's been fun to hack around the rough edges of some of the stuff that's not been entirely cleaned up.  It's something akin to mining for rough gems, as opposed to buying ones that have been carefully cut and polished. 

As a follow-up to Dustin's suggestion, the above collection is the a list most of non-track Codecademy Python courses that can be completed.  If you decide to try them out, be aware that some of them have a few quirks. In some cases, the instructions are not entirely clear, but part of the fun is hacking together a solution that passes.     But, in most of the courses, everything works quite well.
