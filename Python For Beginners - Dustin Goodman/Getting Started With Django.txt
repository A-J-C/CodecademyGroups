Hey guys,

I wanted to get some valuable resources and information regarding Django (the Python web framework) with you in order to help get things started. 

 1.  You will need to have a working version of Python on your computer. Django only supports versions 2.5 to 2.7 so you'll need to ensure this is the version you are running. If it isn't your version of Python, please install it from [the Python Release Site][1] or from [ninite.com][2] (which also has great installs for other great programming resources. Not sure which version of Python you are running? Open up your interpreter and type:

     `import sys
     sys.version`

 2. To install Django, follow [this brief and quick guide][3] provider by the framework creators.

 3. To get started with Django, I recommend you do the [Django Tutorial][4] and read [The Django Book][5]. Both are valuable resources. The Django Book is a little outdated so if there is some inconsistency. Thus, you should trust the Django Tutorial more than the book but the book explains concepts really well so you should still read it for the concepts!

 Hope these help. Happy coding!
