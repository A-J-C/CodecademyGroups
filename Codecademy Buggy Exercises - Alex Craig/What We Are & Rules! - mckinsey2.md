Hello and welcome to Buggy Exercises!
This is a place to post problems of exercises which can be like SCT issues,instructional problems,etc.
General bugs/Website wide bugs (issues pertaining with the site,like codecademy.com not loading,or xyz) are dealt in a group [Codecademy Bug Reporting](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/help-and-bug-reporting).
The Codecademy staff duly visit this group and sort the bugs,so mostly,bugs are fixed within a week here.
And we are committed to make the users’ experience more enjoyable rather than buggy :)

### Rules:
Please read and understand them fully:

 1. If you spot a bug or problem mentioned in the Q&A forum don't hesitate to post it here, how else will we manage to fix it.
 2. Be informative. Bugs cannot be fixed if we don't know what causes them - knowing what browser you use at the very least could be crucial information. [Here’s a post](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51549abe0508c0b97d004add) you can go through.
 3. Please check the [List of known Bugs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmiUmzXzpa1ddGdwRjdHRDlBRkt1eVpBc281a3J3R2c#gid=0) before posting bugs here,so we don’t have duplicate bug reports.
 4. This is not a Q&A forum, so please don't ask questions like "Help! What is the solution of course xyz section 3 exercise 5." or "Please help , I am stuck on xyz lesson ,it gives me this error" and so on.
 5. The same bug report posted twice by the same user ,would be deleted.Like:if user *xyz* posts *abc* bug report twice,then one post would be deleted.So,avoid doing this too.
 6. Please do not post a bug report in continuation to a post.Doing this is not allowed, Remember , Every Bug Report goes in a New Post.
 7. Respect the [Forum Guidelines](http://www.codecademy.com/de/docs/forum_guidelines).
 8. No spamming here.Spam posts will be removed without warning ,and if a spammer persists ,he will be kicked out of the group.
 9. Do not swear or becoming abusive towards anyone in this group.
 10. Please don't advertise any other groups. It will be considered spam.
 11. Do not make posts that aren’t related to bugs in any way.
 12. Please use markdown when posting code. Markdown will show us your indentations and how your code is formatted. It's pleasanter to read. Guidelines about Markdown can be found [here](http://www.codecademy.com/de/docs/forum_guidelines#markdown).
 13. Be polite and respectful to everyone. Respectful disagreement is allowed.
 14. Do not shout i.e. write in UPPERCASE at anyone.
 15. Please refrain from posting reports that are just suggestions (ie. changing something that is intended behaviour) rather than bugs. Unfortunately there may some cases of confusion between intentional features and bugs.

### (CO)LEADER RULES

The status of an issue should be placed within square brackets in uppercase in the title. Below are the following cases:

`[R]` - If Codecademy staff have explicitly acknowledged a bug.
`[F]` - If a bug has been fixed and/or no longer occurs (for whatever reason).
`[MORE INFO]` - If a bug report has insufficient information to be of use.
`[NI]` - If something is  not a bug.
`[DUPLICATE]` - In the case of a duplicate.
`[C]` - In case it's closed


Add `[]` to the start of the title of the post when it is added to the list of known bugs.

We really hope we will be able to fix faulty courses with this group.

Thanks from
Alex and co.
