To help fix exercises ASAP it would help greatly if you included the following:

 1.A title with track (HTML/CSS belong to the 'Web' track), course and exercise number in.

 2.A link to exercise.  [Here's how to do it with Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link).

 3.Description of the problem your having.

 4.If an SCT issue, the code your using. 
SCT stands for **S**ubmission **C**orrectness **T**est . It checks your code for any mistakes you make ,and passes you when you get it all right. "SCT issue" refers to when the SCT behaves abnormally, i.e, passes the wrong code or denies the correct code.

 5.The browser, version and operating system you are using.

 6.A screenshot if it would help. To put a screenshot,follow the steps:
   a. Capture a screenshot.
   b. Upload it on an image-hosting website like tinypic.com or awesomescreenshot.com.
   c. Copy the website URL where your image is shown. Just paste that link here, or [use Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img) to format it.
    

Last but not the least , remember , every new bug report goes in a **new post**.
Posting bug reports in continuation to a post is not allowed.

Thanks please try and include all the above information!
