Hello, before you post a bug please check the list so that we dont have duplicate bug reports. It will make it so much easier for us:) If your bug isnt already on the sheet then post a new bug, but make sure that it has all the required information on, you can find what information is needed [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51549abe0508c0b97d004add).

The list of bugs is on the **Exercise Bugs sheet** of the spreadsheet. You can look at it [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmiUmzXzpa1ddGdwRjdHRDlBRkt1eVpBc281a3J3R2c&usp=sharing).

Remember please check  the list before you post (Press Ctrl/Cmd + H and enter the exercise name/URL)!  We also may not remember to notify you in the post if the bug is fixed, although we will try our best, so it might be a good idea to look on the spreadsheet to see if your bugs have been fixed :)

Last but not the least, here's a list of letters that we use in the column C to indicate the status of each bug:

F : Fixed
R : Reported (in process of fixing)
U : Unreported (a staff will soon have a look at it)
NI : Non-Issue (not a bug)
C : Won't be fixed for the time being

Thanks,
Alex, Gaurang, Glenn, Michael


----------

There are some known errors that you won't easily find on the spreadsheet that are common across courses and languages. Most of these have been fixed, but they still pop up from time to time. Here's a few:

 * Infinite loading on Python track
 * Code not being carried over from one exercise to another
 * Zooming in breaks exercise

I'm sure there are others as well and this list will be updated periodically. Please do not report recurrences of these issues.

---------

Also please go through this checklist to make sure a bug is a bug:

 1. Make sure you have redone the "buggy" exercise by pressing the `Reset Code` button.
    1.1 - Press the `Reset Code` button.
    1.2 - Press the `F5` key (to refresh the web page).
    1.3 - Redo the exercise.
    1.4 - Press the `Save & Submit Code` button.
    1.5 - And notice if the problem persists.

 2. Make sure your browser zoom is at the default level (100 %) . For Chrome, use `Ctrl`+`0` to make it default.
 3. Make sure the track is not Original Track Content ([More info here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/521cdf3780ff33e874000879))
 4. If on Python or Ruby, and you use the code for taking input, then you will have to type in something in the console and then press Enter key to pass. If not done, the `Save & Submit Code` will keep spinning indefinitely.


If any of the above steps still does not fix the problem, then please follow the [guidelines](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51549abe0508c0b97d004add) and report a new bug.
