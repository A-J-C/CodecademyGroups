Hello,
time for another, *hard* challenge.
This one is taken from [one of my courses][1].

> Create a function called `x`, which gets a number `z` as input and returns, how many twin primes between `1` and `z` can be found. So if you pass `10`, your code should return `2`, as `[3;5]` and `[5;7]` are [twin primes][2].
> The one with the least characters wins.
> [Here][3] is a testing function, which returns your points.

Please let me know, whether anything is clear and whether the testing function works.
After coding share your code and your results, so let the competition begin. :-)
