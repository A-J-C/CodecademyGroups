Hello,
it's time for another challenge:

> Create a function called `x`, which gets a string as input and returns an object, which shows, how often a character appeared in this sentence. So if you pass `"Foo"`, your function should return `{F: 1, o:2}`.
>  The user with the shortest function wins.
> [Here][1] is a testing function, which returns your points.

This challenge will run two weeks.
If you have any questions, just ask. :-)
Please share your results (code and points) and start coding. `:-)`
