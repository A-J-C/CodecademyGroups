Hello,
time for another challenge:

> Write a function, which gets a string as input and returns, how often the word `"Is"` or `"is"` (so it is not case-sensitive) is in the string you pass in. Something like `"this"` or `isn't` should not count. So your function ought to return `2`, if you pass the following string: `"Is this true? This is good!"`.
> This task has been there in the discussion forum and I've thought this one would make a good challenge.
> Perhaps check [this Ruby course][1] first, as it does quite the same, but this one shouldn't be case-sensitive and should only return the count of the word `"is"`.
> It is a challenge, as you'll get a basic code, you mustn't change, and the one, who has the least characters (and is the fastest, if many persons have the same amount of characters) wins.
> The basic code: `var findIs = function(s) {};` Just fill in your code and feel free to test and to improve it. :-)

If you have questions, please ask. :-)
This challenge will run two weeks.
Please share your results. :-)

If anyone else wants to start a challenge, just start one (It is okay, if there are many ones at the same time) and perhaps ask a co-leader to pin the challenge. Later you could write an entry in the leaderboard.

Now start coding! :-)
