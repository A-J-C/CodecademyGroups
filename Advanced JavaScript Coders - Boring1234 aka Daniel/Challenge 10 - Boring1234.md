Hello,
as it has been mentioned [already][1], this *challenge* is a `canvas` challenge.
Having completed [this][2] and [this][3] *easy challenges* could be helpful.

> a) Create a function, which accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. The arguments will be arrays, which represent points in a canvas: `a[0]` represents the `x` value of point `a` and `a[1]` the `y` value of point `a`, `b[0]` the `x` value of `b` and `b[1]` the `y` value of `b`. Your function should draw a line between `a` and `b`.
> b) Now try to draw an *arrow* from `a` to `b`. Unfortunately there is no method to draw an arrow, so you'll have to find a way to do it.
> c) Make sure that your function doesn't draw anything, if the points are equal.

This is a very tough challenge and I'm curious, *whether* and *how* you'll do it. :-)
Is everything clear?
Please share your results. :-)
Happy coding!

PS: You also may share only results for a) and c), as b) is really hard and requires some maths. (Well, my solution does)
