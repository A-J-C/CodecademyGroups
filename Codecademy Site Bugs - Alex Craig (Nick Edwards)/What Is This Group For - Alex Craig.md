### What is this group for?

*UPDATED Jun. 28, 2014.*

This group is intended as a central point for users to help the staff identify and collate bugs which occur with the website **with the exception of bugs in exercises**. For exercise bugs please make a report in our other bug reporting group [here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises).  Doing so will allow bugs to be reported and resolved faster, while also preventing hundreds of duplicate reports for the same issue.

Thanks to the staff, co-leaders and active users for making this work and keeping me sane :)

Before you submit a report, please familiarise yourself with the following rules:


----------


### Rules


 **1. This is not for individual exercises** - If you have a problem with a particular exercise, such as incorrect instructions or correctness test failure, please refer to the group [Buggy Exercises][1]. Reports of exercise bugs here will be deleted.

**2.  This is not for suggestions** - Please refrain from posting reports that are suggestions (ie. changing something that is intended behaviour) rather than bugs. Wishlist items can be posted [over here](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/codecademy-discuss/discussions/53336f97548c354a8e0006ca).

**3. Please check to see if your bug has been [previously reported](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/help-and-bug-reporting/discussions/52fff65d80ff333844005126)** - This will prevent duplicate reports on the same issue.  If a bug that was previously resolved occurs again, feel free to start a new thread. 

**4. Be informative** - This applies to both the report and the title.  Bugs cannot be fixed if we don't know what causes them - knowing what browser you use at the very least could be crucial information.  Karen has [written on the subject][2], which I recommend you look through.

 **5. Abide by the usual forum rules, and be awesome.**

----------

### Key to Tags


Posts will now be tagged by co-leaders in the title; please **do not add these tags yourselves** but here is a guide so you know what they mean:

`[R]` - (Reported)  A moderator has confirmed and reported the bug to CC staff.
`[F]` - (Fixed) The bug has been fixed and/or no longer occurs (for whatever reason).
`[MI]` - (More Info) The bug report has insufficient information to be of use. Holding for a while in case more information is forthcoming.
`[NI]` - (Non Issue) Report is about something that is considered intentional behaviour and not a bug. **Report will be deleted soon.**
`[NR]`- (Not Reproducible) Checked but can't replicate problem. Holding for a while in case more information is forthcoming..
`[D]` - (Duplicate) In the case of a duplicate report.  **Report will be deleted soon.**
`[E]` - Exercise Bug (Should be reported to [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises) group). **Report will be deleted soon.**


----------

### N.B.

 - Any posts which are exercise reports, duplicates or non issues will be deleted on a semi-regular basis. To make this process run more smoothly please delete any of these type of reports yourselves after you have been notified of the fact they are not helpful in this group but could be helpful elsewhere.
